Welcome to caf.toolkit's documentation!
=======================================

CAF.Toolkit focusses on generic tools and functions that are used across the :ref:`common analytical framework` (CAF). Much of the functionality added here is sourced from `NorMITs Demand <https://github.com/Transport-for-the-North/NorMITs-Demand>`_, the rest has been built specifically to enhance current CAF packages.

Over time, alongside adding extras functionality to enhance other CAF packages, CAF.Toolkit will be populated with much of the generic functionality found in `NorMITs Demand <https://github.com/Transport-for-the-North/NorMITs-Demand>`_.

Common Analytical Framework
---------------------------

This package is part of the `Common Analytical Framework (CAF) <https://transport-for-the-north.github.io/CAF-Handbook/>`_,
which is a collaboration between transport bodies in the UK to develop and maintain commonly used transport analytics and appraisal tools.
The aim is to make useful transport planning functionalities more widely available and easy to use.
